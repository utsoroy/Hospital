Hospital Readmission Data: A group of hospitals provided the data to obtain a generalized linear model (GLM) that is superior to the LACE index - The LACE index is a simple tool with four parameters: Length of stay, Acuity of admission, Comorbidity, and Emergency visits in the previous 6 months.

The features in the data include:
* **Readmission.Status**: 1 if readmitted, otherwise 0.
* **Gender**: Male(M) or Female(F)
* **Race**: There are four categories: Black, Hispanic, Others, White
* **ER**: The number of emergency room visits prior to the hospital stay associated with the readmission.
* **DRG.Class**: DRG (diagnosis-related group) is composed of 3 class: MED (for medical), SURG (for surgical), UNGROUP.
* **LOS**: Length of stay
* **Age**: Age of the Patient (usually over 65)
* **HCC.Riskscore**: Hierarchical Condition Category risk score. It is designed to be an estimate of a patientâ€™s condition and prospective costs. It is a continuous variable, rounded to three decimal places. Higher numbers indicate greater risk.
* **DRG.Complication**: Complications, with five levels: MedicalMCC.CC, MedicalNoC, Other, SurgMCC.CC, SurgNoC. MCC.CC complications or comorbidities that may may be major. NoC means no complications or comorbidities.
